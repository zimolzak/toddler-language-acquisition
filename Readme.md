Graph of my kid's spoken words over time
========================

Take a log of what words my kid speaks for the first time on any given
date, and make a graph of how his spoken vocabulary grows over time.

Person to do this first was as far as I know Redditor jonjiv.

I'm doing something like that, but with Git + Python + Pandas, so this
might help me learn more about Pandas.
